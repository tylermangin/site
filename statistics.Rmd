### [Categorical Outcomes](individual_categorial_choices.html)

Hopefully this is a less technical description, with more simulation. This is a work in progress that I update as I find and test new methods. I'm sorry if it a bit dry, but I use it mostly as a reference and a laboratory.

### [BLP Estimation Example in R](BLP_estimation_cereal.html)

The original code was written for Matlab by [Aviv Nevo](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~ane686/supplements/rc_dc_code.htm) in 1998. [Michael Carniol](https://github.com/mcarniol/Berry-Levinsohn-and-Pakes-1995-in-R) adapted it into R in 2015, to which I owe the functions and set-up I use here. I just became aware of another R package designed to estimate BLP, [BLPestimatoR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BLPestimatoR/BLPestimatoR.pdf), which I have not had a chance to test.


I ran this routine on a canonical data set from Aviv Nevo. I found the data here: http://www.rasmusen.org/zg604/lectures/blp/. A lot of the description is due to [Nevo's Practitioner's Guide](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~ane686/research/RAs_guide.pdf). Any errors are mine.
